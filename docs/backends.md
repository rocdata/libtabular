Tabular data backends
=====================
For now only CSV is supported (project is still in the proof-of-concept stage).

Roadmap for backends:

- TSV
- Google Sheets
- ODS
- XLS/XLSX
- ?

All backends support the "basic" functionality of CSV for importing and exporting data,
but some backends support "rich" features like formatting and use of `HYPERLINK`s.
